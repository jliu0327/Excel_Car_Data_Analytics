# Excel_Car_Data_Analytics

## Introduction
With an ever-expanding market of car options and rising vehicle prices, choosing the right car at the right price has become more challenging than ever. It is imperative for consumers to make informed decisions, understanding not just the type of car they want but also how its pricing compares to market trends. To simplify this process, I have developed a **Car Pricing Dashboard** in Excel. 

Taken from the kaggle dataset, this interactive tool empowers consumers by providing clear, data-driven insights into car prices, helping them navigate their options with confidence.
